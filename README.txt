TIC TAC TOE

This is a computer game of TIC TAC TOE

I implemented it in Java, and its guaranteed to not be defeated ( 1 in 100000000 )

Compile:
--------

./compile.sh     (if it doesn't work, do:   chmod +x compile.sh  )

or , manually

javac *.java
jar cfmv App.jar Manifest.txt *.class *.wav *.gif *.wav *.png *.JPG *.GIF


  Run
------

java -jar App.jar


Thank you
